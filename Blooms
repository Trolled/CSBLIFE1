Bloom's 6 stages of thinking:
Systems of Inequalities
1.) Knowledge
	- Listen to the teacher carefully, refer to the modules that the teacher gave and ask question about the lesson.
2.) Comprehension
	- Apply the past lesson (Basic Algebra) in mathematics related to the system of inequalities.
3.) Application
	-Apply the present and past lesson learned into the question, which is system of inequalities.
4.) Analysis
 	-Make an examples/samples on each lessons/ideas related to the system of inequalities and test if one the exact algebraic lesson is connected to the system of inequalities.
5.) Synthesis
 	- Like in analysis but looking for more convenient and new ways to solve the problem.
6.) Evaluation
 	- Looking at the problem, we really need to listen and practice at our home. Better yet, be involved in tutorials or group studies.
