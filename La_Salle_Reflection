From the Quote:

"I will always look upon the work of my salvation,
 and the foundation and government of our community, 
as the work of God; hence I will abandon the care of both to him, 
acting only through his orders;… 
I will often consider myself as an instrument which is of no use except in the hands of the workman. 
Hence I must await the orders of Providence before acting, 
and be careful to accomplish them when known."

My Reaction to these words are was thinking for the good side of what you did good and the huge influence of our government.
Giving absolute obedience to god, wherever putting your life in danger just to fulfill his destiny. A noble
act indeed from a common man. Being gods instrument for good and waiting for more orders. As a Student, I could
consider this action, RARELY. I won't have the same experience as the other guys, so, Not really. The line
"be careful to accomplish them when known" the reaction that first came to me is confusion. A conflict between
my experiences in the Philippines, my childhood friends pulling me down or the mentality in other countries.
Lastly, the line "Hence I must await the orders of Providence before acting" I don't agree with this line.
People can act with judgment from others. Providence isn't always right, because, it's just common men in
robes giving out orders or judgment. Judging this saint is hard, wherever he did things from the church or
by his free will. As I was taught he really didn't plan to do a school or gave a whole meaning of education.
By changing the one vs one tutoring to a classroom type that we use today. His achievement teaching the poor
that made france, a 1st world country, changed a lot of ways. Try really hard in the Philippines can be a huge
problem, because of the media and the oligarchs. That made the Philippines poor, when they took down Marcos.
