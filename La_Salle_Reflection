From the Quote:

"I will always look upon the work of my salvation,
 and the foundation and government of our community, 
as the work of God; hence I will abandon the care of both to him, 
acting only through his orders;… 
I will often consider myself as an instrument which is of no use except in the hands of the workman. 
Hence I must await the orders of Providence before acting, 
and be careful to accomplish them when known."

My Reaction to these words are was thinking for the good side of what you did good and the huge influence of our government.
Giving absolute obedience to god, whetever putting you life in danger just to fullfil his destiny. A noble
act indeed from a common man. Being gods instrument for good and waiting for more orders. As a Student, I could
consider this action, RARELY.
