What are the change in your life because of College.

New Role:
In my Circle of friends, I've become the comedian in my peer group. Sharing stories about thing I see in my neighborhood.

New Routines:
I used to wake up 7am in the morning, now I wake up at 5am. Due to the immense trafic in weekdays. I have acquired "chill spots" to hang on. From Mineski infinity to the humble kalindirya.

New relationship:
My new friends are Karl, jay, TJ, Altair, Jeric, Bordo, Jeremy, BLUE!(based on the color of his t-shirt), Steven, Mark, Arvin and names that I forgotten.

New Assumptions:
I REALLY NEED TO STUDY MORE!
